# Unity Soulslike RPG - Open Template

![Thumb](thumb.png)

## Overview

This is an open-source Unity project for a Soulslike RPG, inspired by what I've learned building _Cacildes Adventure_ ([Steam Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617740/Cacildes_Adventure/)). The project is currently in development and will feature core mechanics typical of the Soulslike genre, providing a foundation for developers to build upon.

## Planned Features

- **Combat System**

  - Stamina-based attacks, dodges, and blocks
  - Light and heavy attacks with various weapon types
  - Parry and riposte mechanics
  - Archery system
